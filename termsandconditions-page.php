                        “software-as-a-service”. Each user will be referred to as “Client” or “you”. Vene and Client are each

                        1. General
                    </h5>
                    <p>1.1 Vene operates proprietary software under a software-as-a-service (“Saas”) model (hereinafter the
                        “Software”). The Software is provided as so-called software-as-a-service on a 24/7 basis with an availability
                        of 99% per year excluding times of maintenance as customary in the industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>1.2 Vene offers different Software products. The features of each software product are more particularly
                        described in the features section on the vene.io website. Additionally, Vene may provide consulting,
                        customization and development services related to Client’s use of the Software. In the following, the
                        Software and all related services provided by Vene will be referred to as the ”Services”. </p>
                    <p>1.3 Clients agree to be bound by the terms of these T&C by agreeing to a package offered by Vene, either as
                        written Service Order or by way of sign up on the vene.io website. This procedure shall be referred to as
                        “Sign-up”. The agreement between Vene and Client becomes effective when Vene confirms your Sign-up
                        either executing a signed Service Order, or via email, or by starting to provide the requested Services to you,
                        whichever is earlier. The Sign-up together with these T&C shall be referred to as the “Agreement”. We
                        reserve the right to accept or reject Sign-up applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>1.4 To create your account, we may contact you for further information. You agree to provide the necessary
                        information, and that the information you provide will be complete and accurate. Once your account is ready,
                        we will notify you and provide you with your account log-in details. You can now use the Services. </p>
                    <p>1.5 Vene reserves the right to modify the Software for example by adding, optimizing or removing certain
                        features and functionalities as part of the continuous development of the Software and to keep up with
                        technological and market requirements as well as legislative changes. Accordingly, Client’s right to use the
                        Software is extended, but also limited, to the then-current version of the Software. If a modification is not
                        reasonably acceptable for Client, Client has the right to terminate the Agreement. Such termination shall be
                        the sole right of Client resulting from a modification of the Software by Vene. Vene will communicate
                        upcoming updates reasonably in advance, i.e. three days for regular updates, and at least one hour in case
                        of critical security updates.
                    </p>
                    <p>1.6 The provision of our Services requires the processing of data including personal data. Both parties commit
                        to full compliance with applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations. The Parties agree that

                        processor as defined in applicable privacy laws and regulations. The data processing agreement stipulating
                        the terms of the data processing agreed hereunder is attached to this Agreement as Annex DPA and forms
                        an integral part of this Agreement.
                    </p>
                    <p>1.7 Vene reserves the right to use third parties for the provision of the Services. Where such use of third
                        parties requires the approval of Client under statutory law, such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld
                        or delayed.

                    </h5>
                    <p>4.1 For the term of this Agreement, and subject to its terms, Vene grants to Client the non-exclusive, nontransferable, non-assignable, limited right to use the agreed Services. Vene retains all ownership and
                        intellectual property rights to the Software including derivative works thereof. Client may not, and may not
                        cause or permit others to:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a) remove or modify any parts of, or modify, make derivative works of, disassemble, reverse compile,
                            reverse engineer, reproduce, distribute, republish the Services, or remove or modify any notice of
                            Vene’s proprietary rights; </li>
                        <li>b) make available to third parties, resell, sub-license, or otherwise commercially exploit the Services for
                            its own benefit except as agreed hereunder;
                        </li>
                        <li>c) gain unauthorized access to, manipulate or otherwise interfere with the Software and the operability
                            of the underlying platform.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>4.2 Vene offers additional onboarding, training, support and customization services. The Parties may
                        already agree on certain of such Services during Signup. Additional services are subject to a separate offer
                        by Vene at the request of Client. </p>
                    <p>4.3 The Services may enable Client to add links to third-party media, content, applications and other
                        properties (hereinafter “Third-Party Properties”), and to access such properties of third parties including
                        advertisers, publishers, affiliate networks and others. Furthermore, the use of the Services may require the
                        use of and/or interaction with third-party software and hardware such as for example browser software,
                        operating systems, network infrastructure and others (hereinafter “Third-Party Elements”). Vene assumes
                        no responsibility for Third-Party Properties and Third-Party Elements. Client accesses and uses Third-Party
                        Properties and Third-Party Elements at its own risk and therefore acknowledges and agrees that Vene is
                        not liable for any damages incurred by Client from that use. Vene’s liability in cases where the relevant
                        third-party acts as vicarious agent for Vene, or where Vene has acted as reseller of the relevant Third-Party
                        Property or Third-Party Element, remains unaffected.
                    </p>
                    <p>4.4 Client acknowledges and agrees that Vene will use contents and data provided by Client, or by third
                        parties on behalf of Client, for the purposes of this Agreement, particularly for traffic analysis, service
                        optimization and other agreed purposes. </p>
                    <p>4.5 The Vene anti-fraud solutions categorize traffic based on a several indicators, however, there is no
                        guarantee that the categorization will always be correct. </p>
                    <p>4.5.1 Client acknowledges and agrees that due to the nature of internet fraudulent activities Vene cannot
                        guarantee that its fraud detection and protection solutions will always detect and block 100% of potential
                        threats. It is possible that traffic is blocked based on certain indicators even though there is no proof that
                        the traffic is fraudulent. Vene shall not be held liable for the blocking of such traffic.
                    </p>
                    <p>4.5.2 In such case, Client may notify Vene, and Vene will use best efforts to analyze the situation and to
                        provide a solution. Where the situation cannot be resolved to the reasonable satisfaction of Client, as a
                        sole recourse, Client shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement.
                    </p>
                    <p>4.6 The use of the Vene Services requires a password protected user account. Client ensures that access to
                        its account and use of the password protected or secure areas of the Vene Services is restricted to
                        authorized users only. Client is responsible for all activities that occur under the Client user accounts, and
                        Client agrees to notify Vene of any unauthorized use promptly and without any undue delay. Furthermore,
                        Clients acknowledges and agrees that Vene staff has administrator access to Client user accounts for
                        technical purposes.
                    </p>
                    <p>4.7 It is the responsibility of Client to ensure that Client’s use of the Services is lawful. Therefore, Client
                        warrants and represents to have the right and authority to enter into this Agreement and that its use of the
                        Services will always be in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. Vene reserves the right to
                        suspend Client’s access to the Services where Vene reasonably suspects or believes that Client is in breach
                        of this Section 4.6 and will notify Client without undue delay. </p>
                    <p>4.8 New features and enhancements become part of the Software even if they were requested by a Client
                        and are therefore fully owned by Vene. Unless it is expressly agreed otherwise, Vene reserves the right to
                        make available requested features to other Clients as all other parts of the Services.</p>

                    <p>
                        6.1 If a third party claims that Client’s use of the Software as agreed hereunder infringes their copyright,
                        patent or any other intellectual property right, then Vene will, at its reasonable discretion, either defend such
                        claim while ensuring Client’s continued use of the Services, or acquire the necessary rights to use, or replace
                        or modify the Services so that Client’s use becomes non-infringing and in a way that such replacement or

                    </p>
                    <p>7. Technical and organizational measures. Vene shall take appropriate technical and organizational
                        measures to ensure an appropriate level of security for the Personal Data to the effect that it is reasonably

                        protected against accidental or unauthorized destruction, accidental loss, as well as against unauthorized
                        alteration, disclosure and other access. To the extent that the technical and organizational measures taken
                        by Vene do not fulfil Client’s requirements, Client must notify Vene in writing (text form valid) before
                        Personal Data of Client will be processed. The parties will then discuss and agree in good faith how to
                        modify the technical and organizational measures. Furthermore, Vene reserves the right to modify the
                        technical and organizational security measures from time to time provided that the new level of security
                        does not fall below the previous level in a way that would be non-compliant with applicable law or its
                        agreements with Client. Vene has implemented a process for regularly testing, assessing and evaluating the
                        effectiveness of technical and organizational measures for ensuring the security of the processing.

                    <p>8. Neither party shall knowingly do, nor cause or permit to be done, anything which may result in a breach
                        of applicable law. Client acknowledges and agrees that Client has the sole responsibility for the lawfulness
                        of the processing as instructed hereunder, and Client warrants to Vene that Client is legally allowed to
                        engage Vene for the processing of Personal Data on Client’s behalf and Client has provided all necessary
                        notices to, and obtained all required consents from, the Data Subjects for the processing described in this
                        DPA. </p>
                    <p>9. Client acknowledges and agrees that Vene uses third-party data centers. The current provider is Google
                        Cloud by Google Ireland Limited, with offices at Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. Vene will
                        notify Client about intended changes of providers. The use of a new provider is subject to the approval of
                        Client such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
                    </p>
                    <p>10. Vene reserves the right to utilize data received through Client’s use of the Software to monitor,
                        analyze and optimize the operability of the Services. </p>
                    <p>11. Vene shall document and, at the request of Client, demonstrate to Client Vene’s compliance with the
                        obligations agreed in this DPA using appropriate measures such as for example providing results of a selfaudit, internal security policies, certifications of data and information security, Art. 40 and/or 42 GDPR
                        approved codes of conduct or other appropriate means as the parties may agree.
                    </p>
                    <p>Where audits and inspections by Client or an appointed auditor are necessary, they will be conducted
                        during regular business hours, and without interfering with Vene’s operations, upon prior notice, and
                        observing an appropriate notice period, and the execution of a confidentiality undertaking protecting the
                        data of other Clients and the confidentiality of the technical and organizational measures and safeguards
                        implemented. Vene shall be entitled to reject auditors which are competitors of Vene.
                    </p>
                    <p>12. Where a data subject asserts claims for rectification, erasure or access against Vene, and where Vene
                        can correlate the data subject to Client based on the information provided by the data subject, Vene shall
                        refer such data subject to Client. Vene shall forward clamis of data subjects to Client without undue delay.
                        Vene shall reasonably support Client, where possible, and based upon Client’s instruction insofar as
                        agreed upon. Vene shall not be liable in cases where Client fails to respond to the requests of data
                        subjects in total, correctly, or in a timely manner. Where data subjects assert claims against Client in
                        accordance with Article 82 of the GDPR, Vene shall reasonably support Client in defending against such
                        claims, where possible.
                    </p>
                    <p>13. Vene shall correct or erase Personal Data if so instructed by Client and where covered by the scope of
                        the instructions permissible. Where an erasure, consistent with data protection requirements, or a
                        corresponding restriction of processing is impossible, Vene shall, based on the instructions of Client, and
                        unless agreed upon differently in the Agreement, destroy all carrier media and other material or return the
                        same to Client in compliance with data protection requirements. In specific cases designated by Client,
                        such Personal Data shall be stored or handed over. The associated remuneration and protective measures
                        shall be agreed upon separately. </p>
                    <p>14. Vene shall notify Client of privacy breaches within the scope of Vene’s responsibility. In such case, Vene
                        shall implement all necessary measures necessary for securing Personal Data and for mitigating potential
                        negative consequences for the data subject in coordination with Client without undue delay.
                    </p>
                    <p>15. Where Personal Data becomes subject to search and seizure, an attachment order, confiscation during
                        bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings, or similar events or measures by third parties while in Vene’s
                        control, Vene shall notify Client of such action without undue delay. Vene shall, without undue delay, notify
                        to all pertinent parties in such action, that any data affected thereby is in Client’s sole property and area of
                        responsibility, that data is at Client’s sole disposition, and that Client is the responsible body in the sense of
                        the GDPR.</p>
                    <p>16. This DPA is subject to the laws of Germany. No modification of this DPA shall be valid and binding
                        unless made in writing or in a machine-readable format (in text form), and only if such modification
                        expressly states that such modification applies to the regulations of this DPA. The foregoing shall also apply
                        to any waiver or modification of this mandatory written form.
                    </p>
                    <p>17. This DPA shall take precedence over any colliding stipulations of the Agreement. </p>
                    <p>18. Client and Vene shall be liable to data subjects in accordance with Article 82 of the GDPR each to the
                        extent they are responsible for the damages caused.
